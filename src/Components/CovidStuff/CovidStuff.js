          As this infamous pandemic took over the world, we adjusted our working
          practices so that our employees can be as safe and comfortable as
          possible. We have a hybrid work environment, so you can either work
          from home or visit our lovely office on Sairme Street. If it was up to
          us, we would love you to see us in the office because we think
          face-to-face communications - Zoom meetings. Both on the fun and
          productivity scales.
